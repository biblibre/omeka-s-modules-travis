This tool is used to trigger a Travis build for every Omeka-S module whenever
new commits appear in Omeka S

Requirements:
* perl
* git
* Travis CLI client (https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb)

Before running the script, you need to login with the Travis client:
  $ travis login --org

The script takes no argument, just run it like this:
  $ ./trigger-builds

On first run, it will just clone omeka-s git repository.
On the others runs, it will check if remote develop branch is different from
local develop branch.  If they differ, it will tell travis-ci.org to create new
builds for every module
